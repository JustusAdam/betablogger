I love markdown.

And I am too lazy to keep my old website updated. So, when [Kilian](//kilian.io) tweeted he'd moved his personal website over to [GitHub pages](//pages.github.io) I got tempted to do the same and continue the site and perhaps the blog?? at github pages.

So here we are. This is now hosted by the awesome and generous [GitHub website](//github.com), written in markdown and using [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com) to compile to html.

Unfortunately this means that there will no longer be the option to comment on posts, but it also means a lot less work for me keeping things clean and updated. Plus the site is now waaay faster and I can write this stuff comfortably in [atom editor](//atom.io).

The site's sources are now also hosted on GitHub, [here](//github.com/JustusAdam/justusadam.github.io). Which means if you find a spelling mistake, feel free to send me a pull request ;). The sources are [CC Licensed](/LICENSE.html) so if there's any material you'd like to use in here, fell free to do so.
