There's no favicon, that bothers me.

I was thinking about reusing the old logo, but for some reason it does not appeal to me that much anymore.

So I was thinking I might design a new one. In the includes for the jekyll standard installation there's an embedded github logo (the one in the footer) which is a plain svg image and I very much like the idea of using a plain svg image as logo, because it is so easy to embed and does not take up any space.

As a result I spent this afternoon tinkering with svg and came up with something which I like for the moment.

![A lambda logo](/images/lambda-logo.svg)

What I like is that it is very simple but also a little bit clever, because the lambda hidden within it is not all that visible.

Or perhaps without the line at the bottom?

![Another lambda logo](/images/lambda-logo-sans-linie.svg)

Or perhaps another color?

![Different color](/images/lambda-logo-alternative.svg)

Or perhaps even filled?

![A filled logo](/images/lambda-logo-filled.svg)

I actually quite like this one. It's the filled version but with an added gradient on top.

*Apparently at least Safari cannot display the following image. That's the beautiful thing about SVG though it may be able to describe pictures in a human readable form each implementation is different and, most of the time, incomplete. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) should display it correctly though and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) probably as well.*

__Edit__: of course it turns out I was drawing the logo the wrong way around all this time. Well, I fixed it for the last one, will fix it for whichever one I decide to roll with as well.
