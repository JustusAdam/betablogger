title: Why broom-less flying in Harry Potter makes no sense.

I want to preface this by saying that I absolyitely love the Harry Potter stories. I loved reading all the books, I not enjoy hearing them again in the form of audiobooks and I at least moderatiely liked most of the movies. However theres some aspects about the movies that I take issue with and I won't pick an easy target such as the shrinkheads or the ... knight in the third movie here, but rather one of the novelies introduced in the fifth movie, when things started to get better again.

Flying.

Reasons:

- Teleport is better
- Close range combat makes no sense
- Why white?
- Makes Broomsticks obsolete.
